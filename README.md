This repository contains the core user interface components for [vizhub.com](https://vizhub.com).

It's also where we keep our [public backlog](https://github.com/datavis-tech/vizhub-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc), prioritized by number of :thumbsup: reactions.

 * If you want a certain feature, please give its corresponding GitHub issue a :thumbsup:

For local development there is a [testing app](./src/testingApp), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
