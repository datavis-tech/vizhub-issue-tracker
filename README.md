This repository contains the core user interface components for [vizhub.com](https://vizhub.com).

It's also where we keep our [public backlog](https://github.com/datavis-tech/vizhub-ui/projects/1).

If you discover bugs or have ideas for new features or tweaks, please [open an issue](https://github.com/datavis-tech/vizhub-ui/issues/new).

For local development there is a [testing app](./src/testingApp), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
