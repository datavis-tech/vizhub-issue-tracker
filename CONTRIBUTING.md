# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this repository!

Our typical workflow:

 * Open an issue if there's not one open already for the thing you want to work on.
 * Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on it, possibly proposing a solution.
 * Self-assign the issue when you start to work on it.
 * As soon as work starts, create a Pull Request with "WIP" in the title.
   * This makes Work In Progress visible, so folks know it's underway and can review it.
 * For the commit that closes an issue, please include `Closes #5`, replacing `5` with the issue number.
   * This will make it so that the issue automatically gets closed when the PR gets merged.
 * When the work is done, remove "WIP" from the PR title and request a review from @curran.
 * The work will be reviewed and, if approved, merged and deployed!
